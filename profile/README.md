Render Engine is a static site generator built in Python that allows you to generate websites, pages, and collections, with Python classes.

## The _3 layer_ Architecture 

* **[Page](https://render-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/page)** - A single webpage item built from content, a template, raw data, or a combination of those things.
* **[Collection](https://render-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collection/)** - A group of webpages built from the same template, organized in a single directory
* **[Site](https://render-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/site/)** - The container that helps to render all Pages and Collections with uniform settings and variables
